# RSI

Welcome to the RSI repo, for the Roc Scam Index database
and API.

The goal of this project is to track and bring awareness
to the various types and methods used for scams online.

**This code is still in its design stage**.

Any input during this stage will help greatly benefit
everyone involved in the future. The foundational ideas
are being formed now.

when needed, but right now is intended to organize ideas
for the project.
